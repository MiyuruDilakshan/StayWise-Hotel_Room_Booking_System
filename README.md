# StayWise-Hotel_Room_Booking_System
RoomEase – A full-stack Hotel Room Booking System built with Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB. Features room listings, bookings, user dashboard, and admin panel with full CRUD management for rooms, users, and bookings.

Scaffold added: backend and frontend skeletons

I scaffolded a minimal project foundation so team members can implement pages and features:

- `server/` — Express + Mongoose + Socket.IO scaffold with auth endpoints and DB helper.
- `client/` — React (Vite) skeleton with placeholder routes.
- `.gitignore` and env examples.

How to run (Windows `cmd.exe`):

1. Backend:
```
cd "d:\Fullstack project\StayWise-Hotel_Room_Booking_System\server"
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Frontend:
```
cd "d:\Fullstack project\StayWise-Hotel_Room_Booking_System\client"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Next steps I suggest (I can do these if you want):
- Add `Room`, `Booking` models and CRUD routes in `server/src/models` and `server/src/routes`.
- Add actual frontend pages under `client/src/pages` and hook to API.
- Implement protected routes and token handling on client.

If you want, I'll commit these files, push to the repo, and open a branch for team contributions.
